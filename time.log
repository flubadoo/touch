     1/19  10:00pm  1:20  Converted pseudocode to C. Surprisingly it worked well with

Difficulties encountered:

The most difficult part was figuring out to create a buffer for characters to read in
in order to digit-by-digit replicate the string. Then, the part that took longest was
debugging the buffer - I didn’t realize I needed to reset the buffer and “flush” it each time. Furthermore, considering how to convert from binary/hexadecimal/octal to decimal
was also an interesting problem, but thankfully the standard library provides strtol.
